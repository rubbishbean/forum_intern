This is the version for python 2 (I used 2.7)

This is a forum that allows users of the main website to post,delete,edit and comment threads.
Threads are considered as questions on various topics and the replies are considered as answers.
Answers can win "likes" from other uses and will bring the users who provided the answers scores 
correspondingly.
Users can comment a answer and also "@" someone in the comment. The user that been "@"ed will get
a message saying that he/she has been mentioned in a question.
Each question is tagged and can be searched by the search bar. The tags can be clicked and lead to
the page of all the questions with that tag depending on question popularity from high to low.
The index page shows the hottest questions.

Every user has a user page which shows all questions, answers,likes, scores and new messages on new 
answers/mentions/comments. 

Current database is sqlite that is plugged in python for testing only. The actual running forum was 
configured to work with MySQL.(The website is no longer active due to some reasons).
